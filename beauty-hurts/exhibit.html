															<p>This Ferris Brothers' corset, like many from the early 20th century, achieved a slim waist with laces. However, tightlacing for an extreme hourglass figure could cause health problems like fainting and organ damage.

															<p>Although this particular corset brace was used as a therapeutic device for Joy Weeber's polio, similarly styled corsets from the 19th century were used to shape the body of young girls for the sake of a womanly or more mature appearance.

																Ink, Paper<br>
																<i>Harry T. Peters "America on Stone" Lithography Collection</i>
															</p>
																
															<p>"The Wedding Night" (1850) by J. Schultz is a sentimental genre print, a popular 19th century art form depicting idealized domestic scenes. This lithograph portrays a newlywed couple in a romantic setting, following the typical Victorian image of devoted spouses. While the man unties the woman's corset, a symbol of her "genteel" femininity, their expressions suggest lightheartedness rather than the passionate intimacy often implied. Despite the romanticized scene, such prints offered a limited view of marriage, often neglecting the power dynamics and potential submissiveness expected from women.</p>

															</p>
																
															<p>This seemingly idyllic scene is not quite what it seems. The woman's beautiful red dress is contrasted by the uncomfortably tall, stiff white collar. These collars, while fashionable, were a health hazard. They restricted movement, pinching the neck and making breathing difficult. Dizziness, fainting, and even strokes could result from prolonged wear. Despite the discomfort, social pressure dictated this attire. Even in a casual moment, like leaning out a window, women were constrained by these restrictive collars.</p>

															<p>Victorian sentimental prints depicted a romanticized view of family life, often featuring women in unrealistic clothing. These stiff collars, though fashionable, posed a health risk to women. The collars restricted blood flow and breathing, causing dizziness and fainting. In extreme cases, they could even lead to stroke or death. Despite the discomfort, these collars were a symbol of social status for women during the era. Strict social norms often outweighed health concerns. Thankfully, fashion trends changed in the late 19th century, and women were no longer constrained by these dangerous collars.</p>

															<p>
																1910-1912 C.E. | United States<br>
																Silk, Ostrict Feathers<br>
																<i>Gift of Mrs. Alice Matthew Terry Love</i>
															</p>
																
															<p>This elegant hat embodies a hidden danger of past fashion trends: flammable feathers. While ostrich plumes added a touch of luxury, they were highly susceptible to catching fire. A stray spark from a gaslight or cigarette could ignite the feathery embellishment, causing serious burns to the wearer or nearby individuals. The popularity of feathers from the late 19th century to the early 20th century in millinery fueled the rise of ostrich farms, but these plumes often came at a cost.</p>

															<p>In the mid-19th century, braided and embroidered caps made from muslin and cotton were fashionable accessories for women. Despite their delicate appearance, these caps concealed inherent dangers that threatened the well-being of women. Crafted from highly flammable materials, they posed a significant risk of catching fire in the presence of open flames, such as those found in oil lamps commonly used for lighting. </p>

																18th Century C.E. | United States<br>
																Gold Silk Damask, Wood (heel)<br>
																<i>Gift of Mrs. Douglas Hathaway</i>
															</p>
																
															<p>Heeled shoes from the 18th century, particularly in the United States, were symbols of elegance and status, often crafted from luxurious materials, as seen in the heels on display. However, beneath their ornate appearance lay inherent dangers for women. The elevated heels, though fashionable, destabilized posture, leading to an increased risk of falls and injuries, particularly on uneven surfaces or slippery floors. Other issues that women ran into was how the narrow, pointed toe boxes forced the foot into unnatural positions, contributing to bunions, corns, and other foot deformities. The lack of arch support and cushioning also caused chronic foot pain and discomfort that was exacerbated with prolonged wear. Heeled shoes of the 18th century posed significant risks to women's physical health and mobility, but heeled shoes of today still feature similar issues. </p>

																1955 C.E. | United States<br>
																<i>Gift of Jeanne S. Eddy</i>
															</p>
																
															<p>Though 1955 crinoline petticoats created a stunning silhouette under full skirts, they had their own set of dangers. Made of layers of stiff netting, these petticoats could easily catch fire from open flames or cigarettes. A spark could engulf the voluminous fabric in seconds, causing serious burns. Considering the wide circumferences with this style, fire accidents happened that led to thousands of deaths in the United States. Getting caught in machinery, car doors, or even narrow doorways could cause trips and falls, or worse, become entangled and lead to serious injury. While crinoline petticoats were a popular fashion statement, their wearers had to be constantly vigilant of these hazards.</p>

															<p>
																1980-1920 C.E. | United States<br>

																<i>Gift of Estate of Cassie Mason Myers Julian-James</i>
															</p>
																
															<p>Hair curling iron sets from the late 19th to early 20th centuries in the United States, before electricity was popularized in households outside of the upper class, were indispensable tools for achieving fashionable hairstyles of the time. However, despite their utility, these sets harbored significant dangers for women. Unlike modern curling irons with barrels, these sets consisted of tongs, which required heating over gas burners or open flames. The metal components of the curling irons could become excessively hot, leading to hair damage, breakage, and even accidental scalp burns. Even if households owned electric versions, the risk of electrical fires was high due to the lack of safety standards and proper insulation in such sets.</p>

																N. A. Plimpton & Co.<br>
																Stereograph, Paper
															</p>
																
															<p>This stereograph, titled "Crinoline Difficulties," humorously depicts a danger of the popular 1955 fashion trend: crinoline petticoats. The wide hoops, while creating a fashionable silhouette, could cause wearers to lose balance and tumble. Especially when rushing or navigating uneven surfaces, the crinoline's rigid frame could snag on furniture or the wearer's own feet. These falls could result in scrapes, bruises, or even more serious injuries. As the scene depicts, helping a fallen crinoline wearer required assistance, often revealing layers of petticoats in an embarrassing situation. Despite the fashionable volume, crinoline petticoats demanded caution and a graceful gait to avoid ungainly tumbles.</p>

															<p>
																1907+ C.E. | Atlantic City, New Jersey<br>
																Photograph, Paper
															</p>
																
															<p>In the early 20th century, the fashion for hats adorned with feathers posed significant dangers to women. While these accessories were symbols of elegance and sophistication, they concealed a darker truth. The feathers often came from exotic birds hunted to near extinction. Illustrating this peril is a postcard from Atlantic City, New Jersey, where women proudly showcased their feathered hats. However, beneath the surface of glamor lies a hazardous reality: the hats posed health risks due to the unsanitary conditions in which feathers were processed and the potential transmission of diseases. Feather adornments were not only flammable but also had the potential to carry diseases, posing additional threats to women's well-being. This postcard serves as a stark reminder of the risks women faced in pursuit of fashion, where personal safety was rarely considered.</p>

															</p>
																
															<p>During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the allure of ox marrow pomade and similarly derived animal-based products was widespread, particularly among women seeking hair care remedies. Marketing tactics in the 20th century targeted Black Americans, promising not only hair treatment but a solution to societal beauty ideals. However, these assurances obscured the dangers posed by unregulated ingredients and production methods—at home or manufactured, leaving consumers susceptible to health hazards. The high fat content of ox marrow could attract vermin and lead to poor hygiene, posing a risk in homes where the product was used.</p>

Promoted for its vibrant hue and versatility in cosmetics and fashion, however, it was made with arsenic. This toxic substance, when absorbed through the skin or inhaled, could lead to severe health complications such as organ damage and even death. Despite its dangers, Paris Green dye remained popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with women risking their well-being in pursuit of fashionable appearances.</p>

This practice aimed to achieve a doe-eyed appearance, perceived as enhancing women's beauty. However, the cosmetic use of belladonna extract posed significant risks to women's health. The dilation of pupils caused by belladonna extract could lead to blurred vision, light sensitivity, and temporary blindness, while excessive use could result in severe poisoning symptoms such as hallucinations and cardiac complications.</p>

															<p>In the 1940s, a product marketed for exfoliation caused lasting harm to women's skin, perpetuating harmful beauty standards and racial biases. Designed to lighten skin tone and erase freckles, it reinforced Eurocentric ideals of beauty and marginalized women of color. Despite historical scrutiny, similar products persist today, perpetuating systemic inequalities and stereotypes.</p>
