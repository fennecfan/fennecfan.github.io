									<h1>Narrative</h1>
									<p>Sydney Salinda</p>
								</header>
								<p>I want to include an annotated layout of how I picture the objects as well as some of the materials I would use:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/narrative.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The decisions made in this exhibition were the best option that I found for this particular project because they allowed space for visitors to view the pieces, have a sense of flow, but also no forced direction. I wanted to share this exhibit because it is easy for people to say they understand what women went through for voting rights and body autonomy, but there are other areas that are often ignored and seen as unimportant. This is why I chose to include detailed didactics for each piece, so that people like myself who want to learn more about this project's individual artifacts have the option without doing the research I did. I wanted to share some of the popular items, like corsets and lead in makeup that most people know already to attract attention, as well as some lesser known artifacts to raise awareness and understanding of just how many women suffered—through various ways—in the name of beauty, a topic that was dominated by men at the time. </p>
								<p>With more time, I would probably add kiosks that would have a "click to learn more" feature, but I am currently not that technologically fluent. I also would have changed the numbering sequence to work with the website better, but it made more sense during the checklist process. I care deeply about accessible information, so while it might seem overwhelming, I tried to clearly separate the tombstone for those who prefer to make their own interpretations. Ideally, I would include benches for those interested in viewing the projected images longer. While my exhibit did not turn out as interactive as I initially planned, I used multiple forms of media, projections, and a virtual version of the exhibit for those who would not be able to visit in-person. While the initial budget was an overestimate, I discovered just how versatile these exhibit spaces can become.</p>
